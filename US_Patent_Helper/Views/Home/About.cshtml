    <h1> About Us </h1>
    <h5>
        Patent Helper is a web tool aimed to make the process of comparing patents to their
        continuation in parts (CIP's) easier on the patent worker. Users upload two patents or refer
        to the locally cached patents and run the comparison algorithm which will then highlight
        the text based on its percentage changed. While the project is currently still in development
        we strive to have a completed website by May 2023. Thank you for your patience.
